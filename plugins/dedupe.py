# Usage

Duplicates are determined by the sheet's key columns.

If no key columns are specified, then a duplicate row is one where the values
of *all non-hidden* columns are exactly the same as a row that occurs earlier
in the sheet.

If key columns *are* specified, then duplicates are detected based on the
values in just those columns.

## Commands

- `select-duplicate-rows` sets the selection status in VisiData to `selected`
  for each row in the active sheet that is a duplicate of a prior row.

- `dedupe-rows` pushes a new sheet in which only non-duplicate rows in the
  active sheet are included.
