## `vddedupe.py`

This plugin adds two sheet commands to VisiData:

- `select-duplicate-rows` sets the selection status in VisiData to `selected` for each row in the active sheet that is a duplicate of a prior row.

- `dedupe-rows` pushes a new sheet in which only non-duplicate rows in the active sheet are included.

See [the plugin file](plugins/vddedupe.py) for usage details.

## `vdnormcol.py`

This plugin normalizes column names in any given sheet, so that the names are:

- Composed only of lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.

- Valid Python identifiers. This is mostly handled by the rule above, but also prohibits names beginning with a digit; that is handled by prefixing those names with an underscore.

- Unique within the sheet. Non-unique names are suffixed with "__" and an integer.

Unnamed columns are left as such.

For instance, a sheet with the following columns names:

- "Genus, Species"
- "Height"
- "5-score"
- "Height"
- ""
- ""

... would be converted to have the following column names:

- "genus_species"
- "height__0"
- "_5_score"
- "height__1"
- ""
- ""

This plugin adds one sheet command to VisiData:

- `normalize-col-names` normalizes the names of all *non-hidden* columns in the active sheet, per the approach described above. Alias: `normalize-column-names`.

See [the plugin file](plugins/vdnormcol.py) for additional details.

## `vdtabulate.py`

This plugin makes it possible to save sheets as text-tables, using
the ["tabulate" library](https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate).

The plugin adds two sheet commands to VisiData:

- `tabulate-copy` copies the sheet, as a text-table, to your clipboard
- `tabulate-save` saves the sheet, as a text-table, to file

It also adds one global option to VisiData:

- `tabulate_format` specifies the default text-table format. ([See here](https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate#rst-header-table-format) for valid formats.)

See [the plugin file](plugins/vdtabulate.py) for additional details.

## `vdfec.py`

This plugin adds support for loading the Federal Election Commission's `.fec` files. In order for it to work, you'll need to install [fecfile](https://esonderegger.github.io/fecfile/): `pip install fecfile`. [Demo here](https://asciinema.org/a/Xyh2BFsUaOF0AlHTmMUbqQZPC).

See [the plugin file](plugins/vdfec.py) for additional details.
